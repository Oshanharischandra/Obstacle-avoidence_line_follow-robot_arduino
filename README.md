# Obstacle-avoidence_line_follow-robot_arduino
Arduino code for basic obstacle-avoiding robot using ultrasonic sensor with line follow . In simple this code i created to make a robot that automatically detect a line (path) and follow it when obstacle found , automatically remove the obstacle with actuator arm.
I used Dynamic 1.0 mobile robot to testing purpose of my project.
I will share the circuit diagramme and vedio clips regarding this.
